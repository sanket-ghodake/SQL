# [1661. Average Time of Process per Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/)

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 

Activity table:

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

Output: 

| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

Explanation: 

There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.

Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894

Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995

Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

## First Approach  - `if` condition on `sum`

```sql
select machine_id, 
      round
          (
            (
              (
                sum(if(activity_type = 'end',timestamp,0)) 
                - 
                sum(if(activity_type = 'start',timestamp,0))
              )
              /
              count(distinct process_id)
            )
            ,
            3
          ) as processing_time
from Activity
group by machine_id
;
```

## Making `start` and `end` two columns in the table for easy calculations using `self join` - slower compare to first solution as we join tables

```sql
SELECT a.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a
JOIN Activity b
ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id
  AND
  a.process_id = b.process_id
  AND
  a.activity_type = 'start'
  AND
  b.activity_type = 'end' -- making `end` column by this condition
GROUP BY a.machine_id;


/* -- how to visualize the above table
SELECT a.machine_id, a.process_id, b.timestamp as end_time, a.timestamp as start_time
FROM Activity a
JOIN Activity b
ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id
  AND
  a.process_id = b.process_id
  AND
  a.activity_type = 'start'
  AND
  b.activity_type = 'end' -- making end column by this condition
;
*/

```

## Note -

Adding `if` condition on aggregate functions - there are two ways 

1. `sum(if(activity_type = 'end',timestamp,0))`

2. `SUM(case when activity_type = 'end' then timestamp else 0 end)`
