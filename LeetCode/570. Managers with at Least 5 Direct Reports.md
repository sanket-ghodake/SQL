## Correlated subquery - 3115ms

```sql
select e1.name
from Employee e1
where 5<= (
            select count(*) -- counting managerId occurrences in subquery
            from Employee e2
            where e2.managerId = e1.id
        )
```

## Faster - counting direct managerId occurrences - 649ms

```sql
select name 
from Employee 
where id in 
            (
                select managerId from Employee
                group by managerId
                having count(managerId)>=5
            )
```

## Self join - 753ms

```sql
select  m.name 
from Employee e 
inner join Employee m
on m.id = e.managerid
group by m.id
having count(*) >= 5
```

## Fastest - same as above query [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/solutions/2075668/mysql-beats-90-cross-join/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) - 634ms

```sql
SELECT      E2.name
FROM        Employee E1, Employee E2
WHERE       E1.managerId  = E2.id  
GROUP BY    E1.managerId
HAVING      COUNT(E1.managerId) >= 5
