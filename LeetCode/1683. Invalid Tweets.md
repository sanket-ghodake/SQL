# [1683. Invalid Tweets](https://leetcode.com/problems/invalid-tweets/)

Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

## Using `length()` function - Wrong

```mysql
select tweet_id
from Tweets
where length(content)>15
;
```

## Using `char_length()` function - Correct 

```sql
select tweet_id
from Tweets
where CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

## Note 

In leetcode both of the above solutions are accepted but the second approach is right. 

`LENGTH()` returns the length of the string measured in bytes.<br>
`CHAR_LENGTH()` returns the length of the string measured in characters.
