## [1873. Calculate Special Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus)

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:

| employee_id | name    | salary |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |

Output: 

| employee_id | bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |

Explanation: 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.


### Using Case When 

```SQL
select employee_id, 
    case 
        when (employee_id %2) = 1 and name REGEXP '^[^M]' then salary
        else 0 
    end 'bonus'
from employees
order by employee_id;
```

### Using Conditions itself as `0` or `1` for Arithmetic operation

```SQL
select employee_id,salary*(employee_id%2)*(name not like "M%") as bonus 
from employees 
order by  employee_id;
```

### [Using Union - Breaking problem statement into two parts, Bonus condition and no bonus condition](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/solutions/2489979/mysql-simple-all-approach-with-explanation/?envType=study-plan&envId=sql-i&plan=sql)

```SQL
-- select entries with odd  employee id and name not start with M
    select employee_id , salary as bonus 
    from employees 
    where employee_id%2 <>0 and name not like 'M%'
    
-- join both selection 
    union
    
-- select remaining entries from table 
    select employee_id , 0 as bonus
    from employees
    where employee_id%2 = 0 or name like 'M%'
    order by employee_id;
```

Note :

SQL true false correct use -  `salary*(employee_id%2)*(name not like "M%")` in second solution
