# [620. Not Boring Movies](https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/)

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

## Simple solution 

```sql
select *
from Cinema c
where id%2=1 and description<> 'boring'
order by rating desc;
```

## Using `mod` function

```sql
select *
from cinema
where mod(id, 2) = 1 and description != 'boring'
order by rating DESC
;
```

## Note - 

We can use the mod(id,2)=1 to determine the odd id,

`MOD` function - 

The `MOD()` function accepts two integer values say `N` and `M` (in the same order) and, returns the remainder of the division operation `N` divided by `M`.

Syntax 

```sql
MOD(N,M);
Or,
N%M;
Or,
N MOD M;
```
