# [1211.  Queries Quality and Percentage](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-quality-and-percentage/)


We define query  `quality`  as:

> The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define  `poor query percentage`  as:

> The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each  `query_name`, the  `quality`  and  `poor_query_percentage`.

Both  `quality`  and  `poor_query_percentage`  should be  **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in  **any order**.


## Group by 

```sql
select q.query_name, 
    round
    (
        (sum(q.rating / q.position)) / count(*)
        ,
        2
    ) as quality,
    round
    (
        count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else null end) * 100 / count(*)
        ,
        2
    ) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries q
group by q.query_name
```

## Note

`count()` only check if the value exists or not. `0` is equivalent to an existent value, so it counts one more, while `NULL` is like a non-existent value, so is not counted.

```sql
-- Count every row - 
count(if(q.rating < 3,1,0)) 
count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) 

-- Count every row which has not null value 
count(if(q.rating < 3))

-- Correct version of above queries is using sum function
sum(if(q.rating < 3,1,0)) 
sum(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) 

-- Correct way of counting rows based on condition using count function
count(if(q.rating < 3,1,null))
count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else null end) 
```

### Intuition

Here is correct way to use  `COUNT`  function with  `IF`  condition in MySQL

### Code

```csharp
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select q.query_name, 
    round
    (
        (sum(q.rating / q.position)) / count(*)
        ,
        2
    ) as quality,
    round
    (
        count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else null end) * 100 / count(*)
        ,
        2
    ) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries q
group by q.query_name
```

### Explanation

`count()`  only check if the value exists or not.  `0`  is equivalent to an existent value, so it counts one more, while  `NULL`  is like a non-existent value, so is not counted.

```csharp
// Count every row - 
count(if(q.rating < 3,1,0)) 
count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) 

// Count every row which has not null value 
count(if(q.rating < 3))

// Correct version of above queries is using sum function
sum(if(q.rating < 3,1,0)) 
sum(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) 

// Correct way of counting rows based on condition using count function
count(if(q.rating < 3,1,null))
count(case when q.rating < 3 then 1 else null end) 
```
