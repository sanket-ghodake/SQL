# [1587.  Bank Account Summary II](https://leetcode.com/problems/bank-account-summary-ii/)

Write a solution to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than `10000`. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all transactions involving that account.

## GROUP BY and HAVING 

```sql
select u.name, sum(t.amount) balance
from users u 
inner join transactions t
on u.account = t.account
group by u.name
having sum(t.amount)>10000;
```

## Another way  - Slow

```sql
select u.name, t.amount balance
from users u
inner join 
  (
    select account, sum(amount) amount
    from transactions
    group by account
    having sum(amount)>10000
  ) t
on u.account = t.account;
```

## Third way 

```sql
select u.name, sum(t.amount) balance
from users u 
inner join 
  (select amount, account from transactions) t
on u.account = t.account
group by u.name
having sum(t.amount)>10000;
```
