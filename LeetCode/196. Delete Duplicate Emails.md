## [196. Delete Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails)


Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

Output: 

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

### Making table copy and GROUP By -

```SQL
delete 
from Person 
where id not in 
        (
          select t.id
          from 
            (
              select min(id) as id -- selecting minimum ID that should not be delete from group of Emails
              from Person 
              group by email
            ) t
        ) 
;
# See Note section for better understanding
```

### WITH clause and WINDOW ROW() function

```SQL
-- grouping all emails together and giving them row_numbers and saving as temporary table
WITH temp as(select *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Email order by Id) AS 'row_number'from Person) 
delete 
from Person p
where p.Id = (
            select temp.Id 
            from temp
            where p.Id = temp.Id and temp.row_number !=1
            -- selecting records for delete where row_number in that group should not be 1 and matching there ID's
          )
;
```

### Comparing two tables without joining [Best Approach]

```SQL
-- comparing two tables without joining 
-- best approach 

delete 
from Person
where ID in 
          (
            select * 
            from 
                (
                  select p1.Id
                  from Person p1, Person p2
                  where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id>p2.Id 
                  -- Only selecting greater ID's from second table and with same Emails 
                ) as temp -- we have to make temp table, a copy of original

          )
;
```

### Shorter version of above solution 

```SQL
-- shorter version of above code 

delete p1
from Person p1, Person p2
where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id
;
```


### Note :

```SQL
delete 
from Person 
where id not in 
        (
          select min(id) 
          from Person 
          group by email
        ) 
;
```

This will give Runtime Error - 
`You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause`

So correct syntax is - 

```SQL
delete
from Person
where id not in
    ( 
      select t.id # selecting from temporary copy of table
      from (
              select min(id) as id  # inner select to make table copy
              from Person
              group by email
          ) t
    )
;
```

The thing changed is you explicitly create the temporary table which is a copy of the original table. Without that my sql will use same copy of table and it is problematic since inner select clause may use stale table data which has been deleted by outer query as the query is in progress.
