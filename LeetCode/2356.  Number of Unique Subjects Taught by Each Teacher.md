|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |
**Output:**  

| teacher_id | cnt |
|-------|----------|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

**Explanation:** 

Teacher 1:
  - They teach subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 3.
  
Teacher 2:

  - They teach subject 1 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 2 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.


## `group by` and `count(distinct field)`


```sql
select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) cnt
from Teacher
group by teacher_id;
```

`count(distinct subject_id)`
We can count distinct values on another columns, or any aggregation operation like here
Here we group by teacher_id, and we can do any aggregation operaiton on other columns.
