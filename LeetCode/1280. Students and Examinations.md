# [1280. Students and Examinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/)

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 

Students table:

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |

Subjects table:

| subject_name |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |

Examinations table:

| student_id | subject_name |
|-|-|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |

Output: 

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

Explanation: 

The result table should contain all students and all subjects.

Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.

Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.

Alex did not attend any exams.

John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.



##   `cross join` and then `left join` 

```sql
-- first cross join - assigning all subjects to every student from Students table
-- then left join on above cross join to select Examinations records and also not attended subject exams
-- then counting subjects per student
select s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, ifnull(e.cnt,0) as attended_exams 
from Subjects sub
cross join  Students s
left join 
    (
        select student_id, subject_name, count(*) as cnt 
        -- even if two group by filters, count(*) = count(student_id) = count(subject_name)
        from Examinations
        group by student_id, subject_name
    ) e
on s.student_id = e.student_id and sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
order by s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

## Faster and complex version of above solution [Refer](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/solutions/3861850/100-easy-fast-clean-solution/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```sql
SELECT S.student_id, S.student_name, SUB.subject_name, count(E.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students S
CROSS JOIN Subjects SUB
LEFT OUTER JOIN ExaminationsE
ON S.student_id = E.student_id AND SUB.subject_name = E.subject_name  
GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name,SUB.subject_name
ORDER BY S.student_id, SUB.subject_name
```


## Note - 

Multiple `group by` and aggregate functions - `even if two group by filters, count(*) = count(student_id) = count(subject_name)`

So we need to use **Window functions** when we have to use aggregate functions for every `group by` filter
