## [584. Find Customer Referee](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/)

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

```SQL
select name 
from customer 
where referee_id != 2 or referee_id is null;
```

NOTE : 

`refree_id` can have a `null` value. 

If we have to use `!=` condition, always consider cases with `null` values.

Avoid using `!=` condition if possible, use `=` instead.
