# [1148. Article Views I](https://leetcode.com/problems/article-views-i/)

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Views table:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

Output: 

| id   |
|------|
| 4    |
| 7    |


## Simple solution 

```sql
select distinct author_id id
from Views 
where author_id = viewer_id

order by author_id;
```

## Note 

`author_id` is not a primary key here, so can contain duplicates. So we used `distinct` here
