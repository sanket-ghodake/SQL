# [596.  Classes More Than 5 Students](https://leetcode.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/)



| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |

(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

Write a solution to find all the classes that have  **at least five students**.


## GROUP BY and HAVING 

```sql
select class 
from courses
group by class
having count(student)>=5;
```

## More about duplicate values - 

Here (student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table. So there will be no duplicates values in tabels, but if there are duplicate values then we have to use `distinct`	 with `count` function. 

```sql
select class 
from courses
group by class
having count(distinct student)>=5;
```
