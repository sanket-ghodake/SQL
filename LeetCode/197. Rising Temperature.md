# [197. Rising Temperature](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)

Find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 

Weather table:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

Output: 

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

Explanation: 

In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).

In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

## `DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL expr unit)` 

```sql
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather w1, weather w2
WHERE DATE_SUB(w1.RecordDate, interval 1 Day) = w2.RecordDate 
      AND
      w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
;
```

## `DATEDIFF(expr1, expr2)` - function return difference of dates only

```sql
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather w1, weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.RecordDate, w2.RecordDate)=1
      AND
      w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
```

## `SUBDATE(date, INTERVAL expr unit)` `SUBDATE(expr,days)`

```sql
-- 1
SELECTw1.Id
FROM weather w1, weather w2
WHERE w2.RecordDate = subdate(w1.RecordDate, 1) /*This is w1.RecordDate with 1*/
      AND
      w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
```

```sql
-- 2
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather w1, weather w2
WHERE w1.RecordDate = subdate(w2.RecordDate, -1) /*This is w2.RecordDate with -1*/
      AND
      w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
```

## `TO_DAYS(date)` - return number of days till date from day 0

```sql
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather w1, weather w2
WHERE TO_DAYS(w1.RecordDate) - TO_DAYS(w2.RecordDate) = 1
      AND
      w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
```
