# [577. Employee Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/)

Write an SQL query to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than `1000`.

Return the result table in any order.

## `Left Join` and `is null`

```sql
select name, bonus
from Employee
left join Bonus
on Employee.empId = Bonus.empID
where bonus < 1000 or bonus is null -- selecting records who dont have any bonus, hence checking is null is important
;
```
