# [1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions](https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/)

***We can solve other problems like A-B, B-A, A-(A ∩ B), B-(A ∩ B)***

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Visits

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

Transactions

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

Output: 

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Explanation: 

Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.

Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.

Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.

Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

## Filter on `Left Join` - Fastest

```sql
select v.customer_id, count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from visits v
left join transactions t
using(visit_id)
where t.transaction_id is null
group by v.customer_id
```


## `NOT EXISTS`

```sql
select v.customer_id, count(v.visit_id) count_no_trans
from Visits v
where not exists 
                (
                    select 1 
                    from Transactions t
                    where t.visit_id = v.visit_id
                )
group by v.customer_id
;
```

## `IN` Operator

```sql
select v.customer_id, count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from visits v
where v.visit_id not in 
  (
    select t.visit_id from transactions t
  )
group by v.customer_id;
```

## Note -

The EXISTS clause is much faster than IN when the subquery results is very large. Conversely, the IN clause is faster than EXISTS when the subquery results is very small.[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/solutions/2533481/3-different-solutions-join-not-in-not-exists/comments/1795822)
