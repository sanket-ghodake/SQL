## [183. Customers Who Never Order]()

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table inÂ **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
Customers table:


| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

Orders table:

| id | customerId |
|----|------------|
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |

**Output:**

| Customers |
|-----------|
| Henry     |
| Max       |


### Using Join - 

```SQL
select c.name as Customers
from Customers c
left join Orders o
on c.id = o.customerId
where o.customerId is null;
;
```

### Using Correlated Subquery

```SQL
select c.name Customers
from Customers c
where not exists 
            (
                select 1 
                from Orders o 
                where c.Id = o.CustomerId 
                limit 1
            )
;
```

### Using NOT IN 

```SQL
select C.name Customers
from Customers c
where c.Id not in (select o.CustomerID from Orders o);
```

NOTE :

If the join condition not match then for left or right joins column values will be `null`. Same in first solution, we checked for `null` values to get unmatched rows from left table.

[Are joins faster or inner qurise or simple sql queries?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129923/is-a-join-faster-than-a-where)

Theoretically, no, it shouldn't be any faster. The query optimizer should be able to generate an identical execution plan.

[Does adding 'LIMIT 1' to MySQL queries make them faster when you know there will only be 1 result?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455476/does-adding-limit-1-to-mysql-queries-make-them-faster-when-you-know-there-will)

The answer, in short, is yes. If you limit your result to 1, then even if you are "expecting" one result, the query will be faster because your database wont look through all your records. It will simply stop once it finds a record that matches your query.
