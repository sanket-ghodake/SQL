# [1378. Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-employee-id-with-the-unique-identifier/)

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:

| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |

EmployeeUNI table:

| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

Output: 

| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |

Explanation: 

Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.

The unique ID of Meir is 2.

The unique ID of Winston is 3.

The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.


## Using left join - 

```sql
select u.unique_id, e.name
from Employees e
left join EmployeeUNI u
using(id);
```

## Using alternative to left join - 

```sql
-- left join without left join keyword

select u.unique_id, e.name
from Employees e
join EmployeeUNI u
using(id) -- selecting matching rows

union all -- union all is important as duplicate rows can filter out

select null, e.name -- selecting left tables values with null for the right tables values
from Employees e -- left side table
where not exists -- selecting non matching rows
                (
                  select *
                  from EmployeeUNI u -- right side table
                  where u.id = e.id 
                )
;
```

### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
It's a simple left join problem, but I decided to solve it without using the `left join` functionality directly.

### Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
First, we select all matching rows from two tables, then we select all non-matching rows from table 1 (the left table), and finally, we use **`UNION ALL`** to combine both queries.

### Doubt ??? Is `left join` slower than `union`ðŸ¤”

### Code
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- left join without left join keyword

select u.unique_id, e.name
from Employees e
join EmployeeUNI u
using(id)

union all -- UNION ALL is important as it allows duplicate rows to be retained.

select null, e.name -- Selecting values from the left table where there are null values in the right table
from Employees e -- left side table
where not exists
                (
                  select *
                  from EmployeeUNI u -- right side table
                  where u.id = e.id 
                )
;
```
