# [1251.  Average Selling Price](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/)


Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.  `average_price`  should be  **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in  **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Prices table:

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |

UnitsSold table:

| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |

**Output:** 

| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

**Explanation:** 

Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.

Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96

Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

  and u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id
;
```

## Note - 


### 1. Difference between Natural Join and Equijoin

- ***Natural Join:*** It is a special case of equijoin in which equality condition hold on all attributes which have same name in relations R and S (relations on which join operation is applied).<br> 
Example:  joins the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id`

- ***Equijoin:*** Equijoin is a **special case of conditional join** where only equality condition holds between a pair of attributes.  <br>
Example -  joins the `employees` and `departments` tables on the  `employee_id` and `department_id` respectively. 

### 2. `Using` clause

1. **Using the USING Clause to Match Only One Column When More Than One Column Matches**:

   The `USING` clause is used to join tables based on a specific column with the same name in both tables, even if there are multiple columns with matching names. It ensures that only one column is used for the join.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees
   JOIN departments USING (department_id);
   ```

   In this example, the `USING` clause joins the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id` column, even if other columns have the same name.

2. **NATURAL JOIN and USING Clause are Mutually Exclusive**:

   The `NATURAL JOIN` and `USING` clauses cannot be used together in the same join statement. They are mutually exclusive.
Because - to use `using` clause both tables should have same coloumn names

3. **No Qualifier in Referenced Columns**:

   When using the `USING` clause, you should not qualify (i.e., specify the table name or alias for) the columns being used for the join.

   ```sql
   -- Correct usage
   SELECT * FROM employees
   JOIN departments USING (department_id);

   -- Incorrect usage
   SELECT * FROM employees
   JOIN departments USING (employees.department_id); -- Qualifier on column
   ```

4. **USING Clause Does Not Qualify Join Column**:

   When using the `USING` clause in a join statement, the join column is not qualified with a table alias. Even if the same column name is used elsewhere in the SQL statement, it remains unqualified in the join.

   ```sql
   -- Incorrect
   SELECT e.employee_id, e.department_id
   FROM employees e
   JOIN departments USING (department_id)
   WHERE e.salary > 50000;
   ```

   In this example, `department_id` in the `USING` clause is not qualified with `e.` because it's part of the join condition.

### 3. Multiple conditions in `join` statement

Refer above soultions -  We can add multiple conditions in `on` part or joining filters with `and` `or` operator
```sql
ON a.product_id=b.product_id AND (b.purchase_date BETWEEN a.start_date AND a.end_date)
```

### 4. `1=1` in Joining 

In MySQL, writing `1=1` in a join condition can sometimes make your query more flexible and easier to build dynamically, but it typically doesn't have a significant impact on query performance. The reason is that the optimizer is generally smart enough to recognize such conditions as trivial and optimize them away. 

Here's why people sometimes use `1=1` and how it can be helpful:

1. **Dynamic Queries**: When you're building SQL queries dynamically in your code, it can be useful to start the WHERE clause with `1=1`. This allows you to easily add additional conditions using the `AND` operator without having to check if it's the first condition or not. For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM users
   WHERE 1=1
   AND age > 25
   AND city = 'New York'
   ```

   This makes it straightforward to add or remove conditions in your code without having to worry about whether the `WHERE` keyword needs to be included or not.

2. **Code Readability**: Some developers find it more readable to start a WHERE clause with `1=1` because it's clear that the conditions are being added using `AND`. This can make the SQL code more self-documenting.

### Adding **1=1** in above solution - Runtime - [1494ms](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/submissions/1038094019/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50) - Beats 80.98%of users with MySQL

#### Code
```sql
select p.product_id, round
                    (
                      (
                        // Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold
                        // Total Price of Product = p.price*u.units
                        // Group by product_id
                        sum(p.price*u.units) / sum(u.units) // multiplying at the time of sum - p.price*u.units
                      )
                    ,
                    2
                    ) as average_price
from Prices p
inner join UnitsSold u
on 1=1
  and p.product_id = u.product_id 
  and u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id
;
```

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. **Selection of Columns**:

   - `p.product_id`: This column represents the product ID.
   - `ROUND(..., 2) as average_price`: This calculates the average price of the products and rounds it to two decimal places.

2. **FROM Clause**:

   - `Prices p`: This aliases the `Prices` table as `p`.
   - `UnitsSold u`: This aliases the `UnitsSold` table as `u`.

3. **JOIN Clause**:

   - `INNER JOIN UnitsSold u ON 1=1`: This is an inner join between the `Prices` and `UnitsSold` tables. The condition `1=1` doesn't filter any records, effectively joining all rows from both tables.
   - `p.product_id = u.product_id`: This condition matches records based on the product ID.
   - `u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date`: This condition ensures that the purchase date falls within the specified price date range.

4. **GROUP BY Clause**:

   - `GROUP BY p.product_id`: This groups the results by product ID, so the subsequent aggregate functions operate on each product separately.

5. **Aggregate Function**:

   - `SUM(p.price*u.units) / SUM(u.units)`: This calculates the average price for each product by summing the total price of the product (product price multiplied by the number of units sold) and dividing it by the total number of units sold. It effectively computes the weighted average.

6. **ROUND Function**:

   - `ROUND(..., 2)`: This rounds the calculated average price to two decimal places.

The result of this query is the list of products with their respective product IDs and average prices based on the conditions and calculations explained above.
